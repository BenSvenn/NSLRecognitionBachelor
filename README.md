This is the repository for my bachelor thesis "Comparative Analysis of image classification models for Norwegian sign language recognition".

The dataset used in our research is a self-made NSL fingerspelling dataset containing 24 300 across 27 alphabets. Each alphabet has 600 images taken of a male where ½ of it is with basic white background and the other ½ is of complex background. Each alphabet also has 300 images taken of a female with a basic white background. We want this dataset to be available to the public so further research can be made in the field of NSL recognition. Unfortunately, the dataset was too big for GitHub, and we, therefore, had to upload it to Google Drive.

"Capturing_images.ipynb" contains the code I used to create my dataset. This can be used to expand the current dataset or create a new one.

"Knn-Model.ipynb" contains the code I used in order to create both the KNN models i used in my thesis.

"CNN-Model.ipynb" contains the code I used in order to create the CNN model i used in my thesis.

"SVM-Model.ipynb" contains the code I used in order to create both the SVM models i used in my thesis.

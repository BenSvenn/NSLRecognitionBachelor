This is the repository for my bachelor thesis "Comparative analysis of image classification models for Norwegian sign language recognition".

The dataset used in our research is a selfmade NSL fingerspelling dataset containing 24 300 across 27 alphabets. We want this dataset to be available to the public so further research can be made in the field of NSL recognition. Unfortunently the dataset was to big for github, and we therefore had to upload it to Google Drive.

"Capturing_images.ipynb" contains the code i used to create my dataset. This can be used to expand the current dataset, or create a new one.

"Knn-Model.ipynb" contains the code i used in order to create both the KNN models i used in my thesis.

"CNN-Model.ipynb" contains the code i used in order to create the CNN model i used in my thesis.

"SVM-Model.ipynb" contains the code i used in order to create both the SVM models i used in my thesis.
